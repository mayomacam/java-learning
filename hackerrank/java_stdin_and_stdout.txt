 public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        int i = scan.nextInt();
        double d= scan.nextDouble();
        scan.nextLine();
        String s=scan.nextLine();


here Scanner module for input 

for integer we can normally use scan.nextInt() for input , we don't need a nextline function to make function take second input for second input function


for double we use scan.nextDouble() for input , but we need a nextline funtion for stop talking function of next 

 
for string it's differ because for string we can use two type of function like
1. scan.next()   ;- for single string word input 

2. scan.nextLine()  ;- for single line input as a input

and output are same as normal.
